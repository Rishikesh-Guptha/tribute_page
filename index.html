          <strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong>(15 October 1931 â€“
          27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who
          served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born
          and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
          engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science
          administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
          Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
          was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
          military missile development efforts.He thus came to be known as the
          Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic
          missile and launch vehicle technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role
          in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
          original nuclear test by India in 1974.Kalam was elected as the 11th
          president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
          Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National
          Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",he returned
          to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a
          single term.

        <h2>Career as a scientist</h2>
        <p>
          After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960,
          Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence
          Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau,
          Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the
          Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career
          by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his
          choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee
          working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.In 1969,
          Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
          where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch
          Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in
          near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an
          expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.

        <h2>Presidency</h2>
        <p>
          Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R.
          Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral
          vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal.
          His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.On 10 June 2002,
          the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time,
          expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,and
          both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his
          candidacy.After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam,
          Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field
          clear.On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian
          Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet colleagues.
        </p>
        <p>
          The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in
          Parliament and the state assemblies, with the media claiming that the
          election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone
          conclusion; the count was held on 18 July.Kalam became the 11th
          president of the Republic of India in an easy victory,and moved into
          the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.

            After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the
            Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of
            Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore;
            an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore;
            chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology
            Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna
            University; and an adjunct at many other academic and research
            institutions across India. He taught information technology at the
            International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and
            technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.

          <p>
            In 2011, Kalam was criticised by civil groups over his stand on the
            Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he supported the establishment of
            the nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the
            local people.The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw
            him as a pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the
            assurances he provided regarding the safety features of the plant.

          On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on
          "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of
          Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced
          some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief
          rest.At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he
          collapsed.He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical
          condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of
          life.Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was
          confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.His last
          words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are
          you doing well?
